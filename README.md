# Microsoft_Word_Autosave

Description:
- A simple **local** Microsoft Word autosaving applet that I made for MacOS in 10 min, haha :3

How-2-USE:electron::
1. Open the Applet and Word
2. Click Yes to Run the Script
3. Begin Writing your Document!
4. Every 30 seconds the applet will send the keystroke Command + S to your computer (MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE ACCESSIBILITY PERMISSIONS OF THIS APPLET ON YOUR MAC CHECKED)
5. If you are a geek/stackoverflow-er (Like me :3), you can alter the code and autosave at whatever duration you like, and please, sharing is caring! if you've got a better design, share it with other people!
6. HAVE FUN!
